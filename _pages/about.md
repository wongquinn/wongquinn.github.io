<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I was born and raised in Pingchang, Sichuan, and completed my high school education at Pingchang Middle School. Following that, I obtained a bachelor's degree from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Shandong University. During my time there, I discovered my passion for aerospace engineering, which led me to pursue further studies at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, where I focused on the flight dynamics and control of the rotorcraft. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at Zhejiang University under the guidance of Prof. Chen Zheng and Li Jun. My research interests encompass a wide range of areas including optimal guidance, data-driven control, and path planning for autonomous vehicles.
