<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shandong University with a bachelor‚Äôs degree. After I found that I was passionate about Aerospace Engineering, I switched my major and received the M.Eng from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Right now, I am pursuing the Ph.D. at Zhejiang University, and my research interest includes optimal guidance and path planning for autonomous vehicles.

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
