<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I was born and raised in Pingchang, Sichuan. I attended high school at Pingchang Middle School. Then, I graduated from School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shandong University with a bachelor‚Äôs degree. After I found that I was passionate about Aerospace Engineering, I went on to attend Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, where I studied flight dynamics and control of rotorcrafts. Currently, I am pursuing the Ph.D. at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Chen Zheng and Li Jun, and my research interest covers optimal guidance, data-driven control, and path planning for autonomous vehicles.
