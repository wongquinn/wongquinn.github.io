<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shandong University with a bachelor’s degree. After I found that I was passionate about Aerospace Engineering, I switched my major and received the M.Eng from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Right now, I am pursuing the Ph.D. at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Chen Zheng and Li Jun, and my research interest includes optimal guidance and path planning for autonomous vehicles.
